# Automation-Form-Filling

As a student, we often face a situation whereby there are tonnes of survey forms blasted in our Whatsapp Groups whether it is for assignment or for attendance. Sometimes we might wonder (at least for me ya), is there a way we can automate this process including submitting the form that is filled? The answer is yes, with the help of Selenium.<br>

Selenium is a Python framework which provides libraries for automation tasks, basically a bot :D. To code out the automated form filling program, you need to have selenium installed. Don't worry, I will go one by one while keeping it precise and concise, as what we have learn during English class this semester. >_< <br>

The following will work in Windows:<br>
1. Open command prompt, run pip install selenium (Make sure you have pip installed first)<br>
2. Go to [ChromeDriver - WebDriver website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and download ChromeDriver according to your Chrome version. To check you Chrome version, click the 3 dots below the 'X' button at top right corner then 'Help' then 'About Google Chrome'.<br>
3. Make up a form. [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPnhXBC-LwIL-4RvBlA17jkA19MehvLrT_MNv1Xb-My-dIpA/viewform) is the simple form I have made.<br>
4. Create new python file and write your code and run. The details and explanation of the code are in automation.py file.<br><br>
